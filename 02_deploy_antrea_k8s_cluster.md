# Overview

Antrea Container Network Interface (CNI) [antrea.io] is a k8s-native project that provides programmable networking and security policies for pod workloads. Antrea enables k8s pod networking with IP overlay, software-defined networks via GENEVE or VXLAN encapsulation and is built on the Open vSwitch (OVS). 

The release of VMware NSX-T 3.2 offers customers to integrate their Antrea clusters with NSX-T for centralized container policy management and visibility extending their ability to manage, tag, group and secure their Antrea clusters through an adapter - the Antrea NSX Adapter.
